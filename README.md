# Odin Recipes

This project is part of my learning journey with The Odin Project, where I've been practicing HTML and building a simple recipe website.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: This is the main page that showcases all my recipes.
- `recipes/`: This directory holds individual recipe pages.
  - `lasagna.html`: A sample recipe page for Lasagna.
  - `pizza.html`: A sample recipe page for Pizza.
  - `cake.html`: A sample recipe page for Cake.

## My Learning Journey

### Iteration 1: Index Page
In the first step, I created `index.html`, making sure to include the standard HTML boilerplate. I added a header with `<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>` to introduce my site.

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Next, I created a new directory called `recipes`. I then built a recipe page named `lasagna.html`, following the same boilerplate structure. The `<h1>` heading on this page features the recipe's name.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
I enhanced the `lasagna.html` page with more content:
- An image of the finished lasagna dish.
- A "Description" section where I wrote a couple of paragraphs about the recipe.
- An "Ingredients" section with a list of the necessary ingredients.
- A "Steps" section detailing the steps to make the dish in an ordered list.
### Iteration 4: Adding More Recipes
Finally, I created two more recipe pages for pizza and cake, using the same structure as the first one. I also updated `index.html` to link to all the recipe pages in an unordered list, making it easier to navigate.

## How to View the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the main page and access the recipe pages.
